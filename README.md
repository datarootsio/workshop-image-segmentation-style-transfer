# Style transfer workshop

Do you want to restyle or redesign your interior, but don't want to leave the comfort of your own home? Don't fancy reading through hundreds of interior design albums or going to your local furniture store to try imagining those couches in your own living room? Have you always dreamed of a couch with an extravagant tiger print, but you don't know if it will fit your interior? 

# Content
This tutorial will show you how to apply style transfer to a picture using image segmentation.

The workshop consists of two main tasks:
- The image segmentation task where we create a dataset to built our own segmentation model with the help of transfer learning.
- The style transfer task where we use a pre-trained style tranformer to restyle our interior. 

**Update on 6/03/2023:** We will also discuss the use of new models such as stable diffusion to help with styling and segmentation!

# How to start
